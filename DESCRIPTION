Description: The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) provides one of 
  the most comprehensive time series databases on the Turkish economy. The 'CBRT' 
  package provides functions for accessing the CBRT's electronic data delivery 
  system <https://evds3.tcmb.gov.tr/>. It contains the lists of all data 
  categories and data groups for searching the available variables (data series).  
  As of February 17, 2026, there were 47,986 variables in the dataset. The lists 
  of data categories and data groups can be updated by the user at any time. A 
  specific variable, a group of variables, or all variables in a data group can 
  be downloaded at different frequencies using a variety of aggregation methods.
