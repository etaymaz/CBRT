## Version 0.2.0

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey upgraded the service to version 3 in January 2026. The current version of the CBRT package (0.2.0) has been updated to use the new web server, EVDS3. Since there is no change in function parameters, the users can use the code prepared for earlier versions without any modification.

allCBRTCategories, allCBRTGroups and allCBRTSeries have been updated on February 17, 2026.

The data.table package was a dependency in the previous version, but it is now imported following the suggestion by data.table developers.
